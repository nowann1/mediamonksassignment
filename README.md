# Description

<p>This project was made for MediaMonks by Nahuel Ladeda.</p>

## What you should know

 - Be sure to have Node up to date (I've used Node v15.9.0 for this project) 
 - Run ```npm install``` to install all dependencies.
 - Run ```npm start``` to start the server
 - Go to ```http://localhost:4000/``` to use the service
 - If you only want to use the endpoint ( although is accesible through the Request Page, by pressing the GET button) go to ```http://localhost:4000/v1/getValueFromKey?username=<username>&key=<key>``` and replace ```<username>``` with the username that you just use to make the request, and ```<key>``` with the key of the request you just made.
 - Run ```npm test``` to test the endpoint

### Features

- Monk List: Shows all the monks online in the page.
- Query List: Shows all the queries that you and other monks are making.

This is the login page, a simple login that only takes your username (also it doesn't fit with the Request Page, not the best stylistic choice)

This is the Request Page, this is what you should see once you login, it's quite intuitive.

### Database

I went straigth to NoSQL and used FireStore as my database, after testing MongoDB and having much slower results.

This is the structure of the database
